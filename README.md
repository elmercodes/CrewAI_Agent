# CrewAI_Agent

CrewAI_Agent is an innovative project designed to streamline the process of planning and organizing trips. It leverages specialized agents and tasks to provide a comprehensive solution for travelers looking to optimize their journey experience.

## How It Works

The application operates around the `TripCrew` class, orchestrating the interaction between various travel agents and tasks to create a personalized trip plan:

- **Initialization**: The `TripCrew` class starts with travel details like origin, destination cities, travel dates, and interests.
- **Agent Setup**: Custom agents are created, including experts like an `expert_travel_agent`, `city_selection_expert`, and `local_tour_guide`.
- **Task Execution**: Tasks such as `plan_itinerary`, `identify_city`, and `gather_city_info` are carried out by the agents based on user input and preferences.
- **Crew Execution**: A `Crew` object comprising the defined agents and tasks collectively works to generate the travel plan.

## Usage

To use CrewAI_Agent, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repository/CrewAI_Agent.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
3. Run the main script to start the trip planning process:
